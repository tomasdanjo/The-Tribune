# About the Project
The Tribune is a Filipino media startup that originated from the Cebu Institute of
Technology - University (CIT-U). It continues to grow in diverse discursive spaces,
establishing its reputation as a vanguard of democracy by amplifying the voices of the
marginalized, championing the truth, posing critical questions, and empowering
communities through responsible journalism.
Uninfluenced by vested interests, The Tribune strives to capture and amplify stories
to keep the public well-informed about current events. Its complete editorial independence
ensures that its stories remain untainted and free from external influence.
The Tribune’s web portal, thetribune.com, archives top stories on local and
international events and originally focused on university-related news. It also features
articles on editorials, opinions, sports, science and technology, business, entertainment,
and the environment, aligning with various Sustainable Development Goals by promoting
informed discussions. In addition to its broad range of content, the web portal is dedicated
to providing direct access to unbiased news and well-organized and in-depth articles.
By maintaining editorial independence and a commitment to accuracy, The Tribune
ensures that readers receive reliable information and clear insights, helping them stay
informed about the world around them.
Today, The Tribune continues its campaign against misinformation, ensuring that
readers receive reliable information and clear insights, one story at a time.
